# Intermittent Next.js Link Navigation Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Next.js links intermittently fail to navigate correctly. The issue is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

The application uses Next.js's built-in `<Link>` component to create navigation links. While these generally work, there are instances where clicking a link does not trigger the expected navigation.  This problem seems to be related to specific timing or state conditions within the application.

## Reproduction Steps

The reproduction steps are not perfectly reliable because of the inconsistent nature of the bug.  However, frequent clicking of the links may eventually reveal the issue.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Click the navigation links repeatedly.

## Potential Causes

The cause might be due to:

* **Client-side hydration issues:** Problems in the process of rendering the initial HTML on the server and then hydrating it on the client.
* **State management conflicts:** Interactions between component state updates and route changes.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Unhandled promises or asynchronous events interfering with navigation.

## Solution

The solution involved using the `router.push` method directly to trigger navigation, bypassing the possible issues with the `<Link>` component in certain circumstances.
